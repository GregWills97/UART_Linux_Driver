UART Linux kernel driver for the QEMU versatilepb board. The kernel module comes with an application "uart_echo" to test in userspace.


# To Build
First use git to clone the most recent versions of busybox and the linux kernel. 

## Configuring BusyBox
We will have to manually configure BusyBox. Enter into the busy box and execute:
	"make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- defconfig"

Next bring up the menu configuration with:
	"make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- menuconfig"

Enter into settings and select "Build static binary (no shared libs)"

BusyBox configuration is done, execute "cd .." to go back to the root folder

## Building Linux Kernel and RootFS
To build Linux, execute "make kernel".

To build our rootfs with busybox, execute "make rootfs"

The appropriate files of our driver and application can be packaged into the rootfs with "make install"

# To Run
Execute "make qemu" to load into linux.

First execute the initialization script for the uart module which resides in "/etc/init.d/vpb-uart-init"

This will create our device under the "/dev" directory

Run the test application with "uart_echo"
