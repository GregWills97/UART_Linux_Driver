UART Linux kernel driver for the QEMU versatilepb board. The kernel module comes with an application "uart_echo" to test in userspace.


# To Build
First use git to clone the most recent versions of busybox and the linux kernel. Make sure the directories in the Makefile are pointing to the correct location

## Configuring BusyBox
We will have to manually configure BusyBox. Enter into the busy box and execute:
	"make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- defconfig"

Next bring up the menu configuration with:
	"make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- menuconfig"

Enter into settings and select "Build static binary (no shared libs)"

BusyBox configuration is done, execute "cd .." to go back to the root folder

## Building Linux Kernel and RootFS
To build the Linux kernel and Root filesystem, execute "make all". 

This will also build the UART kernel module and install it into the rootfs

# To Run
Execute "make qemu" to load into linux.

First execute the initialization script for the uart module which resides in "/etc/init.d/vpb-uart-init"

This will create our device under the "/dev" directory

Run the test application with "uart_echo"
