UART Linux kernel driver for the QEMU versatilepb board. The kernel module comes with an application "uart_echo" to test in userspace.


#To Build
First the kernel must be built, execute "make kernel".

Now build the uart kernel driver with "make uart_module"

The appropriate files can be packaged into the rootfs with "make install"


#To Run
Execute "make qemu" to load into linux.

First execute the initialization script for the uart module which resides in "/etc/init.d/vpb-uart-init"

This will create our device under the "/dev" directory

Run the test application with "uart_echo"
